# Data Professional Survey PowerBI

## Project Overview

A YouTuber did a survey on data professionals, so i decided to do some exploratory analysis on the data to know what goes on in the data world. I mean, i am learning to become a data analyst, so why not? ðŸ˜… 

## Data Source

I downloaded the dataset from the YouTuber's Github repository. I took his free bootcamp on YouTube, so i got access from there ðŸ˜€

## Tools

- PowerBI

## Data Cleaning/Preparation

- Delete Unnecessary columns
- Standardized the Data : There was an option for people taking the survey to choose "Other", then specify their answers. So to make my work easier, i decided to just clean it up and made it as just "Other" without specification. Also the "Current Yearly Salary" was in ranges, so i decided to split the ranges and find the average.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

 1. **Average Payment by Role**

### In the above chart we can tell Data Scientists makes the most on Average, and Data Engineers follows, and so on...


 2. **Happiness Rate based on Salary**

### Judging from the survey, we can conclude that the rate at which data professionals are being paid isn't satisfactory to more than half of the people that took the survey.


 3. **Happiness Rate Based on work/life balance**
